## From Tyler:
It looks good! I really only have two notes:  
    In your assert classes, the names of some methods could be changed from "confirm" to "assert", only because assert sounds better to me lol  
    In searchPageSortByDropdown.assert.ts the dropdownAssert method could go into your base class and be used more generically, if it gets used anywhere elseHonestly though, those are just nitpicks because theres nothing else I could find lol
